\section{Work Experience}

\experience{Hardware Technology Intern}{Apple Inc.}{May 2024}{Aug 2024}{
    \achievement{
        Implemented PPROC method to evaluate hardware coverage on
        pixel processing module down to bit-field-level. Coverage result
        provides feedback and guidance for arch test improvement.
        Constructed feedback loop using PPROC
        to optimize test coverage by adjusting parameters.
        Internalize hardware coverage PPROC method into C/C++ testing
        infrastructure to run and provide feedback on-the-fly.

\section{Technical Projects}

\experience{R10K Out-of-Order Processor Redesign with RISC-V ISA}{Architecture}{Jan 2024}{May 2024}{

    \achievement{Engineered advanced features like N-way superscalar, GShare-Best branch
        predictor, early tag broadcasting, and return address stack to reduce
        latency. Revamped memory hierarchy using
        prefetching, associative, multi-ported and non-blocking
        cache, along with victim caching strategies. Optimized dependent memory
        operations with a data-forwarding load-store queue.
    }
    \achievement{
        Designed, implemented and verified microarchitecture at RTL level
        for reservation stations, Icache, Dcache, and load-store
        queue. Successfully simulated and synthesized the processor and
        passed 100\% of test suites. Performanced ranked top 25\% among all.

    }
}
\experience{Batched Quantum Circuit Simulation on CUDA-ready GPU}{GPU}{Sep 2023}{May 2024}{
    \achievement{
        Engineered a CUDA framework for efficient, batched simulation
        of diverse quantum circuits on GPU in parallel.
    }
    \achievement{
        Achieved super-linear enhancements in both simulation efficiency and scalability,
        identifying potential bottleneck areas and proposing corresponding
        optimization strategies.
    }
}

\experience{Compiler Optimization for CUDA Memory Coalescing
    (COALDA)}{Compiler}{Sep 2023}{Dec 2023}{
    \achievement{
        Developed a CUDA compiler optimization tool using AST and canonical forms to transform uncoalesced memory accesses into coalesced patterns, 
        achieving 9x L2 cache writeback reduction and 6.4x read bandwidth improvement, validated through Clang-NVCC integration and NVIDIA Nsight Compute.
    }
}


\experience{Linux-Based Operating System}{Operating System}{Jan 2023}{May 2023}{
    \achievement{
        Developed a \tech{custom thread library} to simulate multi-cpu, multi-threaded
        execution using \textbf{C/C++}. Implemented a sophisticated \tech{kernel pager
        system} for efficient management of applications' virtual memory,
        encompassing the creation, copying, destruction, and allocation of address spaces.
        Engineered robust, \tech{multi-threaded network file server} for reliable
        data exchange. Designed a hierarchical file system with comprehensive
        access control and fine-grained locking mechanisms to secure file
        ownership and permissions.
