\section{Technical Projects}

\experience{R10K Out-of-Order Processor Redesign with RISC-V ISA}{Team Design}{Jan 2024}{Present}{

    \achievement{Engineered advanced features like N-way superscalar, GShare-Best branch
        predictor, early tag broadcasting, and return address stack to reduce
        latency. Revamped memory hierarchy using
        prefetching, associative, multi-ported and non-blocking
        cache, along with victim caching strategies. Optimized dependent memory
        operations with a data-forwarding load-store queue.
    }
    \achievement{
        Designed, implemented and verified modules at RTL level
        like reservation stations, Icache, Dcache, and load-store
        queue. Successfully simulated and synthesized the processor and
        passed 100\% of test suites. Performanced ranked top 25\% among all.

    }
}

\experience{Batched Quantum Circuit Simulation on GPU}{Personal Project}{Sep 2023}{Present}{
    \achievement{
        Engineered a CUDA framework for efficient parallel simulation
        of multiple quantum circuits on GPU, focusing on tackling
        complexities of diverse quantum experiments and integration of
        dynamic shot-branching techniques.
    }
    \achievement{
        Performed extensive performance evaluations, achieving super-linear
        enhancements in both simulation efficiency and scalability,
        identifying potential bottleneck areas and proposing corresponding
        optimization strategies.
    }
}

\experience{Compiler Optimization for CUDA Memory Coalescing
    (COALDA)}{Team Design}{Sep 2023}{Dec 2023}{
    \achievement{
        Boosted CUDA program efficiency by optimizing memory access
        patterns, targeting and restructuring uncoalesced
        memory accesses. Thorough static analysis
        and performance evaluations showed a notable reduction in L2 cache
        bandwidth usage.
    }
    \achievement{
        Established an NVCC-Clang compilation pipeline to make CUDA kernel
        available for IR-level optimization.
    }
}


\experience{Linux-Based Operating System}{Team Design}{Jan 2023}{May 2023}{
    \achievement{
        Developed a custom thread library to simulate multi-cpu, multi-threaded
        execution using C/C++. Implemented a sophisticated kernel pager
        system for efficient management of applications' virtual memory,
        encompassing the
        creation, copying, destruction, and allocation of address spaces.
        Engineered robust, multi-threaded network file server for reliable
        data
        exchange. Designed a hierarchical file system with comprehensive
        access control and fine-grained locking mechanisms to secure file
        ownership and permissions.
